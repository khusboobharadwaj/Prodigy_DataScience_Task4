Sentiment Analysis and Visualization of Social Media Data:
This repository contains a project for analyzing and visualizing sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis on textual data from social media platforms.
Understanding public sentiment towards specific topics or brands is crucial for businesses and researchers. This project aims to analyze social media data to identify sentiment patterns and visualize the results to gain insights into public opinion and attitudes. The analysis helps in making informed decisions and strategizing marketing efforts.

Dataset
The project can work with various sources of social media data such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. For demonstration purposes, the project may include a sample dataset or instructions on how to collect data using APIs provided by social media platforms.

Results
The project will output visualizations such as:
Sentiment distribution (positive, negative, neutral)
Time-series analysis of sentiment over time
Word clouds for positive, negative, and neutral sentiments
Topic modeling to identify common themes
These visualizations will help in understanding the sentiment trends and key topics discussed in the social media data.
